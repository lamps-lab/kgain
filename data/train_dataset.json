(\nClaudia Obrocki\n)\nUniversity of Zurich neuroscientist Sascha Fr\u00fchholz and colleagues recruited 70 European volunteers for psychoacoustic testing on their personal interpretations of a random selection of sounds which included tones made by the creepy whistles. The volunteers did not have forewarning that skull whistle sounds would be included, removing expectations prior to their ratings for each recording.\nThirty-two of the participants also had their brains scanned by fMRI while they heard the death whistles among a randomized mix of sounds from five different categories.\nMost of the volunteers likened the whistle\nto a scream\n.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\"We show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin,\" the team\nfound\n.\nThe researchers explain the strange mix between natural and artificial makes it hard for our brains to categorize, like the\nuncanny valley effect\nin sound-form. The uncanny valley occurs similarly, when our brains can't clearly define what they're seeing as natural or artificial.\nOur brains first categorize a sensory input before using that classification to attribute value, such as likeability.

    "content": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic \u2018yo-yo\u2019 effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.",

    "content": "Scientists Discover Monster Galaxies Lurking in The Early Universe\nSpace\n19 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nA composite image showing JWST's observations of the three 'Red Monster' galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn.\n(NASA/CSA/ESA, M. Xiao & P. A. Oesch/University of Geneva, G. Brammer/Niels Bohr Institute, Dawn JWST Archive)\nIn the early Universe, long before they should have had time to grow, astronomers have found what they're calling 'red monsters': three large galaxies, almost as big as the Milky Way.\nIt's a challenging discovery for several reasons \u2013 not least of which is the contradiction it poses to our understanding of how galaxies formed, back when time and space were mewling newborns in the void.\n\"The question of 'impossibly' massive galaxies shortly after the\nBig Bang\nhas vexed astronomers ever since the first images of the James Webb Space Telescope,\"\nsays astronomer Ivo Labb\u00e9\nof Swinburne University of Technology.\n\"This is akin to finding a toddler weighing 100 kilograms. JWST has now proven monsters do roam the early Universe.\"\nBased on careful observation and analysis, we have a pretty good idea about how many cosmic processes unfold. But one crucial time period eludes us: the early Universe, known as the Cosmic Dawn, the first billion years following the Big Bang.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nWe have some ideas about how fast the Universe assembled itself from the primordial plasma that permeated the early cosmos, but observational evidence has been a little harder to obtain. With the advent of JWST, we've been able to collect that evidence. As the far reaches of space recede, the light from objects within is stretched to the infrared wavelengths with which the powerful space telescope views the Universe, giving us the strongest probe yet for the Cosmic Dawn.\nAccording to our models, galaxies take some time to assemble and grow. We're not entirely sure of the particulars, but the most popular model involves blobs of\ndark matter\n, into which baryonic (or normal) matter is gravitationally collected. As more and more baryonic matter accumulates, it starts to coalesce into stars, swirling around a giant\nblack hole\nin the galactic center.\nAlthough galaxies appear pretty quickly after the Big Bang, the rate at which they grow was thought too slow for massive galaxies to emerge during the Cosmic Dawn.
