    "content": "Creepy Aztec Death Whistles Have a Strange Effect on The Human Brain\nHumans\n19 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\nWhistle found clutched by sacrificial victim at the Aztec temple in Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\n(Jennysnest/Wikipedia/CC By SA 4.0)\nRanging from a threatening hiss to a blood-curdling scream,\nthe sound\nof the\nAztec death whistle\nis as creepy as the skull-like appearance of the instrument that produces it.\nBrain scans suggest the whistle's tones may do more than create a scary ambience.\nSwiss and Norwegian researchers found h\nearing them activates a variety of higher order centers in our brains, suggesting a complexity to the sound that can only be described as an alarming mix of the natural and the eerily unfamiliar.\nIt's no wonder the Aztecs likely used them to enhance\nreligious and\nsacrificial\nrituals\n.\nRumor has it the\nMesoamerican civilization\nalso used the unnerving sound to strike fear into their foes, during warfare, but\nthat has been disputed\nas no whistles have been found at battle sites or in warrior graves.\nThree original skull whistles from the collection of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. (\nClaudia Obrocki\n)\nUniversity of Zurich neuroscientist Sascha Fr\u00fchholz and colleagues recruited 70 European volunteers for psychoacoustic testing on their personal interpretations of a random selection of sounds which included tones made by the creepy whistles. The volunteers did not have forewarning that skull whistle sounds would be included, removing expectations prior to their ratings for each recording.\nThirty-two of the participants also had their brains scanned by fMRI while they heard the death whistles among a randomized mix of sounds from five different categories.\nMost of the volunteers likened the whistle\nto a scream\n.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\"We show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin,\" the team\nfound\n.\nThe researchers explain the strange mix between natural and artificial makes it hard for our brains to categorize, like the\nuncanny valley effect\nin sound-form. The uncanny valley occurs similarly, when our brains can't clearly define what they're seeing as natural or artificial.\nOur brains first categorize a sensory input before using that classification to attribute value, such as likeability. But when something doesn't fall within a clear category, the ambiguity leaves us with an unnerving sensation.\nHearing the whistle's sound activated the low-order auditory cortical regions of the volunteer's brains \u2013 regions which tune into aversive sounds like screams or babies crying an\nd\ndirect the brain to analyze the stimuli on a deeper level.\n\"Skull whistle sounds are\u2026 rather ambiguous in the determination of their sound origin, which intensifies higher-order brain processing,\" the researchers\nwrite\nin their paper.\nCompared to the other tested sounds,\nwhich included some made by humans and animals, some from nature, musical sounds, and sounds made by tools,\nthe skull whistle in particular activated the inferior frontal cortex, which deals with elaborate classification processing, and the medial frontal cortex, a region involved with associative processing.\nWhen all sounds were compared, those made by death whistles were categorized in their own group, one close to alarm sounds such as horn, sirens and firearms as well as near human noises of fear, pain, anger and sad voices.\nHuman sacrifice with original skull whistle (enlarged in red box) as discovered 1987\u201389 at the Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl temple in Mexico City.

    "content": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic \u2018yo-yo\u2019 effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.",

    "content": "Physicists Transformed a Quantum Computer Into a Time Crystal\nPhysics\n24 November 2024\nBy\nMike McRae\n(da-kuk/Getty Images)\nFor the first time, physicists have transformed a quantum processor into a\nstate of matter\nthat seems to defy physics, a breakthrough that could be a step toward making\nquantum computing\nmore practical.\nQuantum computers\npromise to broaden the kinds of algorithms that can be run quickly and practically, potentially speeding up research into many fields, from\nparticle physics\nto\npharmacology\nto\nmeteorology\n.\nMonumental progress has been made in developing the technology's foundations, but as the technology scales up, errors become a major obstacle.\nBy experimentally making a\nquantum\ncomputer behave like a robust form of\ntime crystal\n, a team of physicists from China and the US hope to make the technology less prone to errors as it scales.\nTime crystals are groups of particles that display repeating patterns. Where the patterns that make up regular crystals like diamond and quartz echo through 3D space, time crystals move periodically like a pendulum, tick-tocking through time.\nWhat makes them unique is their ability to do this in absence or in contrast to a driving 'push'. Time crystals oscillate in their lowest energy state to their own rhythm, like a child kicking out in their swing in defiance of their parent's repetitive nudges.\nProposed by renowned physicist\nFrank Wilczek in 2012\n, the idea of time crystals initially received its fair share of doubters.\nSince then,\na number of systems\nwith\ntime-crystal-like behaviors\nhave been demonstrated experimentally, providing engineers with a proven new tool to measure and shape the world, and a potential solution to an accuracy problem in quantum computing.\nWhere typical computing is restricted to logic built using binary figures represented by 1s and 0s, quantum computing's 'qubits' are better suited to unique kinds of computation, allowing for complex algorithms to be solved in a single step.\nA qubit is a blur of possibility, not unlike a clear card table before the dealer reveals a suit as red or black. Just as a card counter can use the odds in their favor, quantum computing uses a qubit's in-built potential to conduct calculations. Combining qubits by entangling their fates builds a bigger deck, tweaking the odds in ever more useful ways.\nUnfortunately, qubits can entangle with just about anything in their environment, randomly shuffling in new cards and throwing the program off their game. Expanding the deck of qubits to the\nthousands required\ndramatically increases the likelihood of\nunwanted noise creeping in\n.\nTime crystals have been\nproposed as means\nof reducing quantum errors previously, though pushing beyond theory into a practical application has proven challenging.\nOne type of time crystal described as 'topological' has an advantage over the others. While isolated oscillations can exhibit time crystal characteristics within a specific zone of particles repeating in space, a\ntopological time crystal\ndisplays the pendulum swing as a bulk feature of a more general system, all thanks to that very same phenomenon of quantum\nentanglement\n.\nThis generalized spread of oscillating activity is less prone to local interference, keeping the pendulum's swing in perfect motion even as isolated areas within the system are pushed and shoved out of alignment.\nBy successfully programming a highly stable form of\nsuperconducting quantum computing\nto exhibit topological time-crystal behavior, the team found it was feasible to create a quantum system that's even less prone to interference.\nPut through its paces, the system could handle a reasonable level of simulated noise in the environment, remaining relatively stable. The experiment also reflected the potential to use similar superconducting circuits to explore the realm of non-equilibrium motion represented by time crystals.\nAs a proof-of-concept, uncanny ticking of time crystals might have an important place in the future of technology.\nThis research was published in\nNature Communications\n.",

    "content": "This Meteorite Just Revealed an Ancient Signal of Water on Mars\nSpace\n22 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nMost of the Lafayette meteorite is kept at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\n(NMNH)\nEvidence is growing that Mars was once sloshy and wet, draped with lakes and oceans, which lapped at shorelines and deposited sediments that are, even as you read these words, being scrutinized by robots rolling across the now dry and dusty surface.\nWater was there. We know it was. But piecing together when and how, and where it went, is a little trickier to figure out. But we just got a big clue: a meteorite that was ejected from Mars 11 million years ago and subsequently made its way to Earth reveals there was liquid water on Mars less than a billion years ago.\nAccording to a new analysis of the Lafayette Meteorite, minerals within it formed in the presence of water 742 million years ago. It's a real breakthrough in the dating of aqueous minerals on Mars, and suggests that, sometimes, Mars might still be a little damp.\n\"Dating these minerals can therefore tell us when there was liquid water at or near the surface of Mars in the planet's geologic past,\"\nsays geochemist Marissa Tremblay\nof Purdue University in the US.\n\"We dated these minerals in the Martian meteorite Lafayette and found that they formed 742 million years ago. We do not think there was abundant liquid water on the surface of Mars at this time. Instead, we think the water came from the melting of nearby subsurface ice called permafrost, and that the permafrost melting was caused by magmatic activity that still occurs periodically on Mars to the present day.\"\nA piece of the Lafayette meteorite at Purdue University.
