    "content": "DNA storage has shown potential to transcend current silicon-based data storage technologies in storage density, longevity and energy consumption. However, writing large-scale data directly into DNA sequences by de novo synthesis remains uneconomical in time and cost4. We present an alternative, parallel strategy that enables the writing of arbitrary data on DNA using premade nucleic acids. Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000\u2009bits on an automated platform with 350\u2009bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable. Such an unconventional modality opens up avenues towards practical data storage and dual-mode data functions in biomolecular systems.",

    "content": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version \u2013\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others \u2013 those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense \u2013 it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly. The inspiration for molecular movable type came from the way our own cells store and process data.\nEvery cell in your body contains your complete genome. What differentiates cells in various tissues is an extra layer of information called the\nepigenome\n. Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments \u2013 brain, liver, skin, etcetera \u2013 have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit.

Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments \u2013 brain, liver, skin, etcetera \u2013 have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit. Speeding up the process, and making it accessible to non-scientists, could help DNA become a viable data storage medium.\nThe paper was published in the journal\nNature\n.",

    "content": "Google's New Chip Could Crack One of Quantum Computing's Biggest Problems\nTech\n11 December 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\nGoogle's new quantum chip Willow.\n(Google)\nIn spite of\nthe advances made\ntowards making\nquantum computers\npractical, qubit-based systems remain unstable and highly vulnerable to errors, something Google may have taken a major step towards fixing.\nThrough a newly unveiled quantum chip called Willow, Google engineers have passed a significant milestone in error handling. Specifically, they've been able to keep a single logical qubit stable enough so errors occur maybe once every hour, which is a vast improvement on previous setups that failed every few seconds.\nQubits\nare the basic building blocks of quantum information. Unlike the bits of classic computing, which can store a 1 or a 0, these qubits can store a 1, a 0, or a superposition of both. The combination is a powerful tool in designing algorithms that can crunch problems that would take a classical computer far too long to solve, if they could manage it at all.\nError levels were tracked in logical qubits (3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, and 7\u00d77), physical qubits, and compared with Google's previous quantum chip Sycamore. (Google AI)\nUnfortunately qubits are delicate things, their superpositions prone to entangling with the environment and losing their mathematical properties.

    "content": "Topologically ordered phases of matter elude Landau\u2019s symmetry-breaking theory, featuring a variety of intriguing properties such as long-range entanglement and intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Their extension to periodically driven systems gives rise to exotic new phenomena that are forbidden in thermal equilibrium. Here, we report the observation of signatures of such a phenomenon\u2014a prethermal topologically ordered time crystal\u2014with programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a square lattice. By periodically driving the superconducting qubits with a surface code Hamiltonian, we observe discrete time-translation symmetry breaking dynamics that is only manifested in the subharmonic temporal response of nonlocal logical operators. We further connect the observed dynamics to the underlying topological order by measuring a nonzero topological entanglement entropy and studying its subsequent dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential to explore exotic topologically ordered nonequilibrium phases of matter with noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.",
