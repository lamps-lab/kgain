    "content": "Creepy Aztec Death Whistles Have a Strange Effect on The Human Brain\nHumans\n19 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\nWhistle found clutched by sacrificial victim at the Aztec temple in Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\n(Jennysnest/Wikipedia/CC By SA 4.0)\nRanging from a threatening hiss to a blood-curdling scream,\nthe sound\nof the\nAztec death whistle\nis as creepy as the skull-like appearance of the instrument that produces it.\nBrain scans suggest the whistle's tones may do more than create a scary ambience.\nSwiss and Norwegian researchers found h\nearing them activates a variety of higher order centers in our brains, suggesting a complexity to the sound that can only be described as an alarming mix of the natural and the eerily unfamiliar.\nIt's no wonder the Aztecs likely used them to enhance\nreligious and\nsacrificial\nrituals\n.\nRumor has it the\nMesoamerican civilization\nalso used the unnerving sound to strike fear into their foes, during warfare, but\nthat has been disputed\nas no whistles have been found at battle sites or in warrior graves.\nThree original skull whistles from the collection of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. (\nClaudia Obrocki\n)\nUniversity of Zurich neuroscientist Sascha Fr\u00fchholz and colleagues recruited 70 European volunteers for psychoacoustic testing on their personal interpretations of a random selection of sounds which included tones made by the creepy whistles. The volunteers did not have forewarning that skull whistle sounds would be included, removing expectations prior to their ratings for each recording.\nThirty-two of the participants also had their brains scanned by fMRI while they heard the death whistles among a randomized mix of sounds from five different categories.\nMost of the volunteers likened the whistle\nto a scream\n.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\"We show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin,\" the team\nfound\n.\nThe researchers explain the strange mix between natural and artificial makes it hard for our brains to categorize, like the\nuncanny valley effect\nin sound-form. The uncanny valley occurs similarly, when our brains can't clearly define what they're seeing as natural or artificial.\nOur brains first categorize a sensory input before using that classification to attribute value, such as likeability. But when something doesn't fall within a clear category, the ambiguity leaves us with an unnerving sensation.\nHearing the whistle's sound activated the low-order auditory cortical regions of the volunteer's brains \u2013 regions which tune into aversive sounds like screams or babies crying an\nd\ndirect the brain to analyze the stimuli on a deeper level.\n\"Skull whistle sounds are\u2026 rather ambiguous in the determination of their sound origin, which intensifies higher-order brain processing,\" the researchers\nwrite\nin their paper.\nCompared to the other tested sounds,\nwhich included some made by humans and animals, some from nature, musical sounds, and sounds made by tools,\nthe skull whistle in particular activated the inferior frontal cortex, which deals with elaborate classification processing, and the medial frontal cortex, a region involved with associative processing.\nWhen all sounds were compared, those made by death whistles were categorized in their own group, one close to alarm sounds such as horn, sirens and firearms as well as near human noises of fear, pain, anger and sad voices.\nHuman sacrifice with original skull whistle (enlarged in red box) as discovered 1987\u201389 at the Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl temple in Mexico City.
