    "content": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version \u2013\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others \u2013 those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense \u2013 it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly.

    "content": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version \u2013\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others \u2013 those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense \u2013 it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts.

    "content": "This Meteorite Just Revealed an Ancient Signal of Water on Mars\nSpace\n22 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nMost of the Lafayette meteorite is kept at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\n(NMNH)\nEvidence is growing that Mars was once sloshy and wet, draped with lakes and oceans, which lapped at shorelines and deposited sediments that are, even as you read these words, being scrutinized by robots rolling across the now dry and dusty surface.\nWater was there. We know it was. But piecing together when and how, and where it went, is a little trickier to figure out. But we just got a big clue: a meteorite that was ejected from Mars 11 million years ago and subsequently made its way to Earth reveals there was liquid water on Mars less than a billion years ago.\nAccording to a new analysis of the Lafayette Meteorite, minerals within it formed in the presence of water 742 million years ago. It's a real breakthrough in the dating of aqueous minerals on Mars, and suggests that, sometimes, Mars might still be a little damp.\n\"Dating these minerals can therefore tell us when there was liquid water at or near the surface of Mars in the planet's geologic past,\"\nsays geochemist Marissa Tremblay\nof Purdue University in the US.\n\"We dated these minerals in the Martian meteorite Lafayette and found that they formed 742 million years ago. We do not think there was abundant liquid water on the surface of Mars at this time. Instead, we think the water came from the melting of nearby subsurface ice called permafrost, and that the permafrost melting was caused by magmatic activity that still occurs periodically on Mars to the present day.\"\nA piece of the Lafayette meteorite at Purdue University. (\nPurdue Brand Studio\n)\nOne of the materials in question is a type of rock called\niddingsite\n, which forms from volcanic basalt in the presence of liquid water. The Lafayette Meteorite contains iddingsite, which itself fortuitously contains inclusions of argon.\nDating minerals can be a little tricky, but we've been getting much better at it as our technology advances. A technique called radiometric dating can be used on\nisotopes of argon\nto obtain a precise record of when the element formed. Argon emerges from the radioactive decay of potassium; but, when there is no potassium present, a single sample of the isotope argon-40 can still be dated.\nThis is because the amount of the lighter isotope argon-39 that emerges when argon-40 is irradiated in a nuclear reactor is dependent on the amount of potassium that was present initially. This means the argon-39 produced can be used as a proxy for potassium; and, since potassium decays at a known rate, this means that scientists can work out how long it has been since the rock formed.\nThe researchers used this technique on a small sample of the Lafayette meteorite to work out how long it had been since water and rock had interacted to create iddingsite.\nBeing ejected from Mars during an impact event, zooming through the Solar System, then falling smack into Earth through its atmosphere, being heated on the way down, can also change rocks. The researchers were able to model and account for the temperature changes experienced by the meteorite on its long journey, and determine what effect, if any, they would have had on the apparent age of the sample.\n\"The [estimated] age could have been affected by the impact that ejected the Lafayette Meteorite from Mars, the heating Lafayette experienced during the 11 million years it was floating out in space, or the heating Lafayette experienced when it fell to Earth and burned up a little bit in Earth's atmosphere,\"\nTremblay says\n.\n\"But we were able to demonstrate that none of these things affected the age of aqueous alteration in Lafayette.\"\nA sample of olivine (green) and iddingsite (brown).

The new date, the team also found, coincides with a period of heightened volcanic activity on Mars.
