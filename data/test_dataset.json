Skull whistles can produce softer hiss-like but also aversive and scream-like sounds that were potentially meaningful either for sacrificial practices, mythological symbolism, or intimidating warfare of the Aztecs. However, solid psychoacoustic evidence for any theory is missing, especially how human listeners cognitively and affectively respond to skull whistle sounds. Using psychoacoustic listening and classification experiments, we show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin.

(Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\n\"The power consumption of cooling infrastructure for energy-intensive data centers and other large electronic systems is skyrocketing,\"\nsays\nmaterials scientist Guihua Yu, from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\"That trend isn't dissipating anytime soon, so it's critical to develop new ways, like the material we've created, for efficient and sustainable cooling of devices operating at kilowatt levels and even higher power.\"\nThe TIM developed here is a colloidal mixture of the liquid metal\ngalinstan\nand particles of\naluminum nitride\n, combined in a way that creates a gradient interface \u2013 one that helps heat pass through without any hard boundaries between the two substances.\nGalinstan and aluminum nitride were combined to make the material. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\nIn an experimental lab test setup, the TIM was able to double the amount of heat that could be safely transferred away from every square centimeter of an electronic component, compared to a leading thermal paste \u2013 while also reducing the component's overall temperature.\nThe setup used a\ncooling pump\n, which is a common protection against overheating, and the TIM cut the energy use of the pump by 65 percent. This was only a small-scale example, but it shows the heat-transferring potential of the material.\n\"This breakthrough brings us closer to achieving the ideal performance predicted by theory, enabling more sustainable cooling solutions for high-power electronics,\"\nsays\nKai Wu, from Sichuan University.\nThe next step is to get the material working on larger systems and in a wider variety of scenarios, something the researchers are already in the process of doing by partnering up with data center providers.\nAnalysts expect data center electricity usage in 2028\nto be double\nwhat it was in 2023, driven largely by the increasing demands of\nartificial intelligence\nmodels. That presents a real energy demand problem \u2013 one that scientists are working hard to solve.\n\"Our material can enable sustainable cooling in energy-intensive applications, from data centers to aerospace, paving the way for more efficient and eco-friendly technologies,\"\nsays\nWu.\nThe research has been published in\nNature Nanotechnology\n.",

    "content": "This Meteorite Just Revealed an Ancient Signal of Water on Mars\nSpace\n22 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nMost of the Lafayette meteorite is kept at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\n(NMNH)\nEvidence is growing that Mars was once sloshy and wet, draped with lakes and oceans, which lapped at shorelines and deposited sediments that are, even as you read these words, being scrutinized by robots rolling across the now dry and dusty surface.\nWater was there. We know it was. But piecing together when and how, and where it went, is a little trickier to figure out. But we just got a big clue: a meteorite that was ejected from Mars 11 million years ago and subsequently made its way to Earth reveals there was liquid water on Mars less than a billion years ago.\nAccording to a new analysis of the Lafayette Meteorite, minerals within it formed in the presence of water 742 million years ago. It's a real breakthrough in the dating of aqueous minerals on Mars, and suggests that, sometimes, Mars might still be a little damp.\n\"Dating these minerals can therefore tell us when there was liquid water at or near the surface of Mars in the planet's geologic past,\"\nsays geochemist Marissa Tremblay\nof Purdue University in the US.\n\"We dated these minerals in the Martian meteorite Lafayette and found that they formed 742 million years ago. We do not think there was abundant liquid water on the surface of Mars at this time. Instead, we think the water came from the melting of nearby subsurface ice called permafrost, and that the permafrost melting was caused by magmatic activity that still occurs periodically on Mars to the present day.\"\nA piece of the Lafayette meteorite at Purdue University. (\nPurdue Brand Studio\n)\nOne of the materials in question is a type of rock called\niddingsite\n, which forms from volcanic basalt in the presence of liquid water. The Lafayette Meteorite contains iddingsite, which itself fortuitously contains inclusions of argon.\nDating minerals can be a little tricky, but we've been getting much better at it as our technology advances. A technique called radiometric dating can be used on\nisotopes of argon\nto obtain a precise record of when the element formed. Argon emerges from the radioactive decay of potassium; but, when there is no potassium present, a single sample of the isotope argon-40 can still be dated.\nThis is because the amount of the lighter isotope argon-39 that emerges when argon-40 is irradiated in a nuclear reactor is dependent on the amount of potassium that was present initially.
