# Internal Voting Guidelines

## Objective 
The main goal is to identify reliable questions for each sample. There are a total of **10** samples, 10 candidate questions per sample. 
 
## Voting Instructions
Vote for reliable questions **before reviewing the correct answers** to maintain an unbiased evaluation. For each sample, we have three types of questions:
- **True/False**
Vote for **2 out of 4** candidate questions

- **Easy Multiple Choice**
Vote for **2 out of 3** candidate questions

- **Hard Multiple Choice**
Vote for **2 out of 3** candidate questions

**Note**:  
Vote only once per sample and select exactly two questions per category.
